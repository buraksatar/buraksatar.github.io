I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at NTU, Singapore, under the SINGA scholarship by A*STAR.

I work on **video retrieval** by addressing **biases via causal inference** under the supervision of [Prof. Joo Hwee Lim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BjEDX4EAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr Hongyuan Zhu](https://hongyuanzhu.github.io/) from I2R, A*STAR and [Prof. Hanwang Zhang](https://mreallab.github.io/people.html) from SCSE, NTU.

I did my MSc under the supervision of [Prof. Ahmet Emir Dirik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cfgcBIEAAAAJ&hl=tr) on vehicle detection. I have various working experiences, from a start-up in Istanbul to Turkish Airlines Technology and doing an internship at the University of Valencia during my MSc.
