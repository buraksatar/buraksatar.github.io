I am a third-year PhD candidate at NTU & A*STAR, Singapore, under the SINGA scholarship.

I work on **video understanding with multi-modal features** by addressing **causal inference** under the supervision of [Prof. Joo Hwee Lim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BjEDX4EAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr Hongyuan Zhu](https://hongyuanzhu.github.io/) from A*STAR and [Prof. Hanwang Zhang](https://mreallab.github.io/people.html) from NTU. My physical locations are Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) and Media and Interactive Computing Lab (MICL).

I did my master's under the supervision of [Prof. Ahmet Emir Dirik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cfgcBIEAAAAJ&hl=tr) on vehicle detection. I have various working experiences, from a start-up in Istanbul to Turkish Airlines Technology and doing an internship at the University of Valencia.
