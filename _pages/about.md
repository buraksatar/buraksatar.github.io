I am currently a Research Scientist at Singapore Management University (SMU), working under the guidance of [Prof Chong-Wah Ngo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HM39HrUAAAAJ&hl=en). My focus is on culturally aware multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with reasoning capabilities specific to Southeast Asia. <code style="color : LightSkyBlue">Reach out to me for collaboration on cultural context!</code>

I obtained my PhD from the College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, supported by the SINGA scholarship from the Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR). My doctoral research focused on **Towards Semantic, Debiased and Moment Video Retrieval with Multi-modal Features** conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Joo Hwee Lim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BjEDX4EAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr Hongyuan Zhu](https://hongyuanzhu.github.io/) and [Prof. Hanwang Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=YG0DFyYAAAAJ&hl=en&inst=14102473421921925766). During my PhD studies, I had the opportunity to visit the University of Bristol, in the UK, collaborating with [Prof. Michael Wray](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gFQcKZMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao&inst=14102473421921925766) in Dima Damen's research group. I completed my Master’s degree under the guidance of [Prof. Ahmet Emir Dirik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cfgcBIEAAAAJ&hl=tr), specializing in vehicle detection. My professional experiences span a range of roles, including work at a start-up in Istanbul, Turkish Airlines Technology, and an internship at the University of Valencia. Additionally, I have provided advisory support to two award-winning start-ups located in London and Istanbul.
